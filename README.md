# R-programming

## Overview
This project analyzes BMW car data to understand market trends and consumer preferences. The dataset includes attributes like model year, mileage, transmission type, fuel type, and model.

## Data Collection
Data was scraped from blocket.se using Instance Data Scraper.

## Preprocessing
Missing values were handled, and categorical variables were converted to numeric format.

## Model Building
Regression models were developed to predict car prices based on various attributes. Evaluation metrics like R-squared, AIC, and BIC were used.

## Analysis
We incorporated registered car sales data from Statistics Sweden (SCB) to observe market trends, particularly the rise in electric and hybrid car sales.
